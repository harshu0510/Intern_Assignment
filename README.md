1. Introduction:

Hi! My name is Harsh Tiwari and I've built a tax calculator. This calculator helps you estimate your potential tax liability by considering your income, deductions, and age.

2. Calculator Features:

This calculator estimates your federal income tax based on your gross income, extra income, deductions, and age (which can affect certain tax credits).
It can also help you calculate your state income tax (if applicable).

3. Using the Calculator:

Launch the calculator.
Enter the following information:
Gross Income: Your total annual income from salary, bonuses, investments, and other sources.
Extra Income: Any income outside your gross income, like freelance work or side hustles.
Age: Your current age.
Deductions: Expenses you can subtract from your taxable income, such as mortgage interest, student loan interest, and charitable donations.
Click the "Calculate" button.
The results will be displayed with the modal on the screen.

4. Output:

Effective Tax Rate (optional): The percentage of your total income that you may pay in taxes.

5. Disclaimer:
